# OpenTracksESP32DistanceSpeed
Open Tracks ESP32 bicycle distance and speed monitor. The goal of the project is to create a small, battery powered device that connects to OpenTracks Open Source Android app using BLE to send basic ride data.
It will provide more accurate readings than GPS, allowing users to lower GPS accuracy even more for battery savings, or just disable GPS alltogether. 

The idea is to use reed switch with a magnet at first, but also gyroscope/accelerometer on 'wire/magnetless' version.
